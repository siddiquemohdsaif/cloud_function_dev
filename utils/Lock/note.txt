# Lock : for single instance.
# LockRedis : for multi-instance in same computer , i.e leverage cpu cores.


# Now the user is less so use simple lock because we run only one node instance.
  In future if use multi node i.e cluster use RedisLockManager to make it work properly


# To use redisLock simply replace import and usage.
